# PJM-stuff
•	Node = Point = Station = Substation (different terminology for the same stuff)

•	All NODES have a ZONE

•	Some NODES are tied to a HUB and ZONE

•	Not all ZONES have a HUB. When there is no HUB, then a proxy HUB may be used.

•	ZONE is not a real thing, it is a fictions collection of NODES (points) that may or may not be in a same HUB. (Sugarland/Missouri City are not a hub but may be a ZONE that is a collection of various NODES in the region and thus get a ZONE price)

On a side note: ERCOT North HUB is a simple average of 15 or 20, 345 KV  NODES 

ERCOT has only 1 price per node (this is a Total Price…more on that below)

PJM, however has 4 prices.  3 of these are components of the 4th (Total Price). PJM allows traders to trade all 4 prices.

Components of TOTAL price in PJM:

Energy Price (Essentially the cost of production of 1 unit of power)
+
Loss Price (From Generation point to Node – this is loss due to resistance and quantified as $)
+
Congestion Price (Demand ≠ Generation). If Demand >Generation => Positive Congestion. If Demand < Generation => Negative Congestion

= Total Energy Price




•	watt = volt x amp
